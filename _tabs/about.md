As an investment professional with a passion for coding and investing, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow in my field. 

I have a unique skill set that allows me to approach problems from both a technical and analytical perspective. I am experienced in a variety of programming languages, having started a decade ago learning VBA, before moving out of the limiations of excel into Python and R. 

I am skilled in financial analysis and have a deep understanding of investment strategies across asset classes. I have worked across the financial industry for financial planning firms, asset consultants and investment managers. 

In addition to my technical abilities, I am a strong communicator and team player, able to work effectively with others to achieve a common goal. I am also highly motivated and take great pride in my work, always striving for excellence in everything I do.
