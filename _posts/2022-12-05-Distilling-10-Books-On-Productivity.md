>“The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” ― Henry David Thoreau, Walden

Often when I am doing the monotonous life admin, I will listen to Blinkist on a certain topic and let it roll through book after book. After listening to 3 or 4 books on a certain topic, my attention drifts in an out. Drifting out after you hear the commonality across a topic and back in when you hear the nuances between them.

Below are my thoughts on setting, structuring and achieving goals. I'll use a goal of my own as an example:

>I want to write about productivity and motivation.

## 1) Write it Down

Writing things down is a way in which we can improve the commitment to a goal. It also helps to review and improve on the goal; help reflect on it and determine whether you really want it in the first place.

Think about why it is you want to achieve the goal. Is it worth dedicating your time to. Is there something more specific you are trying to achieve. That should be your goal instead.

## 2) Make it Specific
Goals need specificity in order to be able to feel like we're progressing towards them. They need to have a specific aciton, a set time and the rational as to why it's important.

>I want to write about productivity and motivation.

Should be be rewritten:

>I want to write twelve articles on productivity over the next twelve months, to help me synthesise things I have learnt and reinforce the habits about which I am writing.

This structure follows this logic:
    
>I want to 'X' by 'Y' because 'Z'

As an example, X, Y and Z could be:

>- X = action = 'write twelve articles on productivity'
>- Y = time = 'next twelve months'
>- Z = motivation = 'synthesise things I have learnt and reinforce the habits I am writing about'

## 3) Break it down

Every journey consists of single steps. 

Large goals can feel overwhelming and can lead to hestitation to start given how large it is. When breaking down the primary goals into sub-goals, you can omit the motivation, provided you have the ability to refer back to why the sub-tasks matter in the context of the primary goal. 

>I want to write one blog post on productivity each month.

Writing twelve posts in a year is the same as writing one post per month. I work week to week, so I tend to focus on breaking things down to weekly sub-tasks. For tasks which have a less structured period, which is not monthly such as this example, some estimation of time to complete the task is required.


## 4) Make it Urgent
Once you have broken down the task into sub-tasks, some planning is to figure out when you need to complete sub-task one, to progress to sub-task two. Decide on when you will do the task.

Urgent things may pop up from time to time, factor in a day or two. So, if the aim is to complete it by Friday, aim for Wednesday.

I like to use task scheduling tool like Microsoft To-Do.

## 5) Frame it Right

The words we use can have a signficant influence on likelihood of whether we will actually follow through with a goal. A commitment to a goal will be both more satisfying and feel more important to achieve. 

## To Summarise
The main goal changes from:

>I want to write about productivity and motivation.

... to something which outlines why it is important...

>I want to write twelve articles on productivity over the next twelve months, to help me synthesise things I have learnt and reinforce the habits about which I am writing.

... to something manageable...

>I want to write one post on productivity each month.

... to something with more urgency...

>I want to write one post on productivity by Wednesday.

... to something which is a commitment to yourself...

>I will write one post on productivity by Wednesday.
