## What is MidJourney?
[MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com) is an AI image generator that utilizes machine learning algorithms to produce highly realistic images of various objects, scenes, and landscapes. MidJourney is capable of generating stunning visual content by learning from vast amounts of data and then applying that knowledge to generate new, unique images.

## Creating from an image
Aside from creating images from scratch, MidJourney can also take images and along with prompts to create new images. 

Let's start with my linkedin profile photo.

MidJourney requires at least one text prompt, if the prompt isn't specific you'll receive very random results.

```
/imagine prompt: <photo link> ?
```
![Imagine1](/assets/images/2023-02-21/2023-02-21-imagine1.png){: width="100" height="100" }

I'm trying not to take bird face one personally. 

Let's try something more specific.

```
/imagine prompt: <photo link> 80 year old man
```
![Imagine2](/assets/images/2023-02-21/2023-02-21-imagine2.png){: width="100" height="100" }

It's pretty impressive results from a very short and non descriptive prompt. Now let's add some more specific words to the prompt to improve the output quality. 

```
/imagine prompt: <photo link> 80 year old natural light, Hyper Realistic Photography, Hyperdetail, Ultrahd, hdr, color grading, 8k
```
![Imagine3](/assets/images/2023-02-21/2023-02-21-imagine3.png){: width="100" height="100" }

From here we can select one of the four panels to upscale into a more detailed image. I reckon the top left panel is probably what I'll look like, provided I don't change my hair style.

## Limitations
While MidJourney and other AI image generators have shown remarkable progress in creating visually stunning graphics and artworks, the idea that they will completely replace human graphic designers seems unrealistic, or at the very least, not something that will happen in the near future.

Here's a few reasons why:

- Minor changes a major problem. 
 ```
/imagine prompt bird in blue hat
 ``` 
![Imagine5](/assets/images/2023-02-21/2023-02-21-imagine5.png){: width="100" height="100" }
 
 ```
/imagine prompt bird in blue hat
 ``` 
![Imagine6](/assets/images/2023-02-21/2023-02-21-imagine6.png){: width="100" height="100" }
- Can't handle text. 
```
/imagine prompt sign saying hello world
```
![Imagine7](/assets/images/2023-02-21/2023-02-21-imagine7.png){: width="100" height="100" }

- Image quality.
MidJourney produces rastered images rather than vectors, which creates issues when trying to englarge the image. With a maximum of 3MB file size there is a limitation to how large the images can become. This isn't so much of an issue when viewing on a computer,tablet or phone. But this is a serious limitation to printing images. There are of course some workarounds.

## Thoughts

Despite the hype, the integration of AI image generators in the design process is still in its very early stages. 

The images generated are called rastered images, which are very low quality and
